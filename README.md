# easybgm: Easy Bayesian Graphical Modeling

The `R` package `easybgm` provides a user-friendly package for
performing a Bayesian analysis of psychometric networks. In particular,
it helps to fit, extract, and visualize the results of a Bayesian
graphical model commonly used in the social-behavioral sciences. The
package is a wrapper around existing packages. So far, the package
supports fitting and extracting results of cross-sectional network
models using `BDgraph` (Mohammadi & Wit, 2015), `BGGM`(Williams &
Mulder, 2019), and `bgms` (Marsman & Haslbeck, 2023). As output, the
package extracts the posterior parameter estimates, the posterior
inclusion probability, the inclusion Bayes factor, and optionally
posterior samples of the parameters and the nodes centrality. The
package comes with an extensive suite of visualization functions.

## Overview

### Estimation

The package consists of wrapper functions around existing R packages
(i.e., `BDgraph`, `bgms`, and `BGGM`). To initiate estimation,
researchers must specify the data set and the data type (i.e.,
continuous, mixed, ordinal, or binary). Based on the data type
specification, `easybgm` estimates the network using the appropriate R
package (i.e., `BDgraph` for continuous and mixed data, and `bgms` for
ordinal and binary data). Users can override the default package
selection by specifying their preferred R package with the `package`
argument. All other arguments, such as package-specific informed prior
specifications, can be passed to `easybgm`. As output, `easybgm` returns
the posterior parameter estimates, the posterior inclusion probability,
and the inclusion Bayes factor. In addition, the package extracts the
posterior samples of the parameters by setting `save = TRUE` and the
strength centrality samples by setting `centrality = TRUE`.

### Visualization

The package comes with an extensive suite of functions to visualize the
results of the Bayesian analysis of networks. We provide more
information on each of the plots below. The visualization functions use
`qgraph` (Epskamp et al., 2012) or `ggplot2` (Wickham, 2016) as the
backbone.

#### Edge Evidence Plot

The edge evidence plot aids researchers in deciding which edges provide
robust inferential conclusions. In the edge evidence plot, edges
represent the inclusion Bayes factor $`\text{BF}_{10}`$. Red edges
indicate evidence for edge absence (i.e., conditional independence),
grey edges indicate the absence of evidence, and blue edges indicate
evidence for edge presence (i.e., conditional dependence). By default, a
$`\text{BF}_{10} > 10`$ is considered strong evidence for inclusion and
$`\text{BF}_{01} > 10`$ for exclusion. Users can specify the threshold
for Bayes factors.

#### Network Plot

In the network plot, edges indicate the strength of partial association
between two nodes. The network plot shows all edges with an inclusion
Bayes factor greater than $1$, i.e.Â all edges that have some evidence of
inclusion. Edge thickness and saturation represent the strength of the
association; the thicker the edge, the stronger the association. Red
edges indicate negative associations and blue edges indicate positive
associations.

#### Structure Plots

The structure uncertainty can be assessed with the posterior structure
probability plot and the posterior complexity plot. The posterior
structure probability plot shows the posterior probabilities of the
visited structures, sorted from the most to the least probable. Each dot
represents one structure. The more structures with similar posterior
probability, the more uncertain the true structure. If one structure
dominates the posterior structure probability, we can be relatively
certain about the true structure.

The posterior complexity plot shows the posterior probability of a
structure complexity (i.e., number of present edges in a network). Here,
the posterior probability of all structures with the same complexity are
aggregated into one plot.

#### 95 % Highest Density Intervals of the Posterior Parameter Distribution

The 95 % highest density intervals (HDI) of the parameters are
visualized with a parameter forest plot. In the plot, dots represent the
median of the posterior samples and the lines indicate the shortest
interval that covers 95% of the posterior distribution. The narrower an
interval, the more stable a parameter.

#### Centrality Plot

Researchers often use centrality measures to obtain aggregated
information for each node, such as the connectedness quantified by
strength centrality. Credible intervals for strength centrality can be
obtained by calculating the centrality measure for each sample of the
posterior distribution. The higher the centrality, the more connected
the node; error bars represent the 95% High Density Interval (HDI).

## Example

We want to illustrate the package use with an example. In particular, we
use the women and mathematics data which can be loaded with the package
`BGGM`. We fit the model and extract its results with the function
`easybgm`. We specify the data and the data type, which in this case is
`binary`.

``` r
library(easybgm)
library(BGGM)

data <- na.omit(women_math)
colnames(women_math) <- c("LCA", "GND", "SCT", "NMF", "SBP", "FTP")

res <- easybgm(data, type = "binary")
```

Having fitted the model, we can now take a look at its results.

``` r

Furthermore, we can visualize the results with plots. In a first step,
we assess the edge evidence plot in which edges represent the inclusion
Bayes factor $`\text{BF}_{10}`$. Especially in a large network like
ours, it is useful to split the edge evidence plot in two parts by
setting the `split` argument to `TRUE`. As such, the left plot shows
edges with some evidence for inclusion (i.e., $`\text{BF}_{10} > 1`$),
where blue edges represent evidence for inclusion
($`\text{BF}_{10} > 10`$) and grey edges absence of evidence
($`1 < \text{BF}_{10} < 10`$). The right edge evidence plot shows edges
with some evidence for exclusion (i.e., $`\text{BF}_{10} < 1`$) with
evidence for exclusion shown as red ($`\text{BF}_{01} > 10`$) and
inconclusive evidence as grey ($`0.1 < \text{BF}_{10} < 1`$).

``` r
plot_edgeevidence(res, edge.width = 2, split = T)
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_edgeevidence.png)

Furthermore, we can look at the network plot in which edges represent
the partial associations.

``` r
plot_network(res, layout = "spring", 
             layoutScale = c(.8,1), palette = "R",
             theme = "TeamFortress", vsize = 6)
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_network.png)

We can also assess the structure specifically with three plots. Note
that this only works, if we use either the `BDgraph` or `bgms` package.

``` r
plot_structure_probabilities(res, as_BF = FALSE)
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_structure_probabilities.png)

``` r
plot_complexity_probabilities(res, as_BF = FALSE)
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_complexity_probabilities.png)

``` r
plot_structure(res, layoutScale = c(.8,1), palette = "R",
               theme = "TeamFortress", vsize = 6, edge.width = .3, layout = "spring")
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_structure.png)

In addition we can obtain posterior samples from the posterior
distribution by setting `save = TRUE` in the `easybgm` function and
thereby open up new possibilities of assessing the model. We can extract
the posterior density of the parameters with a parameter forest plot.

``` r
res <- easybgm(data, type = "binary", save = TRUE, centrality = TRUE)
plot_parameterHDI(res)
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_parameterHDI.png)

Furthermore, researcher can wish to aggregate the findings of the
network model, commonly done with centrality measures. Due to the
discussion around the meaningfulness of centrality measures in
psychometric network models, we recommend users to stick to the strength
centrality. To obtain the centrality measures, users need to set
`save = TRUE` and `centrality = TRUE`, when estimating the network model
with `easybgm`. The centrality measures can be inspected with the
centrality plot.

``` r
plot_centrality(res, measures = "Strength")
```

![](man/readme_plots/plot_centrality.png)
